* I chose to develop a SPA using Angular 1.5. It is what I am currently most comfortable with. I use the new component router, which is depricated, because why not, it only just came out.
* My biggest struggle was the mock data, but once it was good enough the rest of the app feel into place.
* I'm assuming that the data will be coming from a web api call.
* I like to use a "cookie-cutter" approach with my Angular 1 apps. The are very simple patterns you can follow and everything tends to go in only a couple of places. It also forces you to really think about where logic should go.
